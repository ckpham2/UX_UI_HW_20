                  <h3>The Problem</h3>
                  <p class="livingroom-text3">People find it difficult to visualize how furniture would fit their space when shopping for home furnishings. How might we design LivingRoom so that when people shop for furniture online, they can get recommendations for furniture according to the style of their space, visualize the furniture in there, and compare different models in order to get the best price and quality?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="casestudy-body">
                  <h3>The Solution</h3>
                  <p class="livingroom-text3">By using UX/UI Design, user reseatch and AR technology, we created an app that allows users are able to visualize their room's design before committing to buying furniture.</p>

                <p class="livingroom-text2">We then defined our user persona.</p>
                <p class="livingroom-text2">Finally we designed, tested and then iterated our wireframe prototype based on user test results.</p>

                  <p class="livingroom-text2">After gathering data from 16 survey responses, we conducted 6 one-on-one interviews with users who provided information into their thought process when purchasing furniture, with a goal to gain insight on how to make furniture shopping a better experience.</p>

Through doing this it help us create our user persona, Anthony Rodriguez.</p>

                <p class="livingroom-text2">We concluded that it would be most impactful if users could create their own room design and inspiration boards and virtually measure their room dimensions to see their furniture in place before going to the store.</p>

                  <p class="livingroom-text2">Once we had our user flow, we began creating our lo-fi wireframes and developed a user testing plan for our prototype. We had 6 users test our intital prototype. We asked our users to complete 3 tasks.</p>

                  <p class="livingroom-text2">Our team’s goal was to determine whether LivingRoom functions as intended. Are users able to successfully flow through the app’s feature’s with ease? What are some pain points and frustrations that the user encountered? And how can we improve upon the things they don’t like in the app?</p>
                  <p class="livingroom-text2">All of our users were able to successfully work through each task. However, they had some suggestions that we could improve upon. For instance, one users suggested back buttons for the user survey portion. Another user recommended clarity in how one might enter room dimensions manually. Upon checkout, one user would have liked to see a review order tab on the final checkout page.</p>
                  <p class="livingroom-text2">Overall, users liked how much guidance they were given. They also liked seeing progress bars when there were several tasks asked of them.</p>

            <div class="casestudy-body">
                <p class="livingroom-text2">Designing with the user in mind is something I learned the most in the exploration. Keeping in mind the considerations for design that people who may not be familiar with AR technology. While it was challenging, but it allowed us to make more informed design decisions on what helped the user and what did not. This was also one of the first projects I worked on that made me go through the entire UX process from ideation, user research, market analysis, visuals all the way to protoyping. In essence, it allowed me to fully test my UX design process and how to execute it in a timeline while collaborating with designers on my team.</p>
